No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.  If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.  </p>\n                        <h2 className=\"mt-3 text-left\">OPTIONS REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION</h2>\n                        <h4 className=\"mt-3 text-left\">[Account Information]</h4>\n                        <p className=\"text-justify p-2\">You may at any time review or change the information in your account or terminate your account by:</p>\n                            <ul className=\"text-left\">\n                            <li>Logging into your account settings and updating your account</li>\n                            <li>Contacting us using the contact information provided below</li>\n                            <li>[Other]</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        <p className=\"text-justify p-2\">Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases.
